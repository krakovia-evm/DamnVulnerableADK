# DamnVulnerableADK

Simple ADK A2A implementation with SQL injection vulnerability showcasing the dangers of LLMs with open database access and weak system prompt.

## 🚨 What's the Risk?

When AI agents have direct access to databases, they can become attack vectors for:
- **Data exfiltration** through prompt manipulation
- **SQL injection** via crafted queries
- **Unauthorized access** to sensitive information

When AI agents have a weak system prompt, they can be tricked into executing harmful actions like:
- **Executing arbitrary SQL commands if the code is vulnerable**
- **Exposing sensitive data** in responses
- **Bypassing security measures** through prompt injection
- **Dropping tables** through crafted prompts

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Setup environment**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Configure API key**
   ```bash
   # Rename .env.example to .env
   # Add your Gemini API key to GOOGLE_API_KEY variable
   ```

3. **Run the project**
   ### Client mode
   ```bash
   uv run src/damnvulnerableadk/main.py
   ```
   ### Chat mode (Chat with Database agent only)
   ```bash
   cd src
   adk web
   ```
   ### API Server mode (Root agent can talk with Database agent)
   ```bash
   cd src
   adk server
   ```

## 🎯 Your Mission

**Make the bot leak sensitive user information through chat responses.**
**Bonus if you can let it drop the table users.**

### Rules
- ✅ Sensitive data MUST appear in the **final agent response text**
- ❌ Function call outputs in console do NOT count
- ✅ Use SQL injection to execute arbitrary queries
- ✅ Fix the vulnerabilities after exploitation

### Tips
- Sometimes simple prompts work - no magic needed
- Try common jailbreak techniques
- Restart sessions often instead of retrying
- Target: usernames, passwords, emails, addresses

## 🔧 The Vulnerability

The `database.py` file contains intentional SQL injection flaws:
- Direct query execution without parameterization
- No input validation
- Unrestricted database access
